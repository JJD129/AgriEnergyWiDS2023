# Women in Data Science (WiDS Datathon) 2023

In advance of the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Stanford Conference to be held on March 8, 2023, we invite you to build a team, hone your data science skills, and join us for the 6th Annual WiDS Datathon focused on social impact. In this year’s datathon challenges participants will use data science to improve longer-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

The WiDS Datathon encourages women worldwide to hone their data science skills, creating a supportive environment for women to connect with others in their community who share their interests. Data scientists of all levels are invited to participate in the datathon, including beginners.

REGISTER HERE to compete in the WiDS Datathon. All participants must register to participate in the challenge.

## Background on the challenge

Extreme weather events are sweeping the globe and range from heat waves, wildfires and drought to hurricanes, extreme rainfall and flooding. These weather events have multiple impacts on agriculture, energy, transportation, as well as low resource communities and disaster planning in countries across the globe.

Accurate long-term forecasts of temperature and precipitation are crucial to help people prepare and adapt to these extreme weather events. Currently, purely physics-based models dominate short-term weather forecasting. But these models have a limited forecast horizon. The availability of meteorological data offers an opportunity for data scientists to improve sub-seasonal forecasts by blending physics-based forecasts with machine learning. Sub-seasonal forecasts for weather and climate conditions (lead-times ranging from 15 to more than 45 days) would help communities and industries adapt to the challenges brought on by climate change.

## Overview: the dataset and challenge

This year’s datathon, organized by the WiDS Worldwide team at Stanford University, Harvard University IACS, Arthur, and the WiDS Datathon Committee, will focus on longer-term weather forecasting to help communities adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

The dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI). Participants will submit forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year, competing against the other teams as well as official forecasts from NOAA.

## Who can participate

The dataset and challenge is accessible to both beginners and experienced participants from industry, government, NGOs and academia. Whether you’re currently working in the field or just starting to learn about data science, we welcome all participants. For those who have never tried machine learning, we will provide a series of guides to help you get started with the algorithms and dataset.

## Team guidelines and formation
The WiDS Datathon aims to provide women with hands-on experiences addressing real-world problems, to inspire women worldwide to hone their data science skills, and to create a supportive environment for women to connect with others in their community who share their interests.

Toward these ends, the WiDS Datathon is open to individuals or teams of up to 4 people; at least half of each team must be individuals who identify as women.

You can connect with WiDS Datathon participants through the dedicated WiDS Datathon Slack channel and at weekly team building events hosted by the WiDS Datathon team. Please be sure to register to receive these invitations. Many WiDS ambassadors will host datathon workshops, where participants will be able to receive mentorship, form teams, and hone their data science skills. Check back frequently, as workshops are posted daily.

## How it works
The WiDS Datathon will run until March 1, 2023.

Data analysis can be completed using your preferred tools. Tutorials, sample code, and other resources will be posted throughout the competition on the Kaggle Tutorial and Resources page. You will then upload your predictions for a test set to Kaggle and these will be used to determine the public leaderboard rankings and the winners of the competition.

Winners will be announced at the WiDS Stanford conference held in-person and online, on March 8, 2023. Beyond the leaderboard rankings, prizes will also be awarded to the best high school and undergraduate teams. Special thanks to Kaggle for supporting the suite of WiDS Datathon cash awards this year, totaling $25,000 USD!
